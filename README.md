# color-identifier
- In this color identification Python project, going to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them. 
- The Dataset : Colors are made up of 3 primary colors; red, green, and blue. In computers, we define each color value within a range of 0 to 255. So in how many ways we can         define a color? The answer is 256*256*256 = 16,581,375. There are approximately 16.5 million different ways to represent a color. In this dataset, we need to map each colorâ€™s     values with their corresponding names.
- At the end , this model gives the results that by pointing any area at any picture we can get the correct color-name and shade that show how well this work.
